# The `ramen` package

This package contains classes to support making a bot that plays Rocket League: 
`Agent`, `Task`, and `Action`, as well as some helper functions in `control`.

The classes for representing objects in the game, as well as interfacing directly
with RLBot are in the `vitamins` package.

The intention is that nothing in `ramen` or `vitamins` should need to be modified,
instead your code can import and use these assets. Of course there's nothing to 
stop you from improving them (and submitting a pull request, thanks!).
